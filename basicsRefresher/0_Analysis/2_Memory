Bit : Its fundamental unit of information in computers, binary digit can have two values 0 or 1.

Byte: 8 bits are equal to 1 byte, 00000001 is one byte
      a single byte can represent upto 2^8 values (256 distinct values)
      
Integer: Represented in either 32 bits or 64 bits, basically group of 4/8 distinct bytes
       decimal number 1 represented in 32 bit - 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
       all integers are represented similarly in fixed size irrespective of their decimal value, so each representation has limit to hold values
       beyond which the representation will become invalid.
       
Storage in Memory: Data stored in memory is represented by bytes (combination of bits)
                   These bytes can also point to other bytes in memory by way of reference
                   The storage memory is limited by these units, so needs to be utilized judiciously
                   Accessing a byte of memory is elementary operation, this can be termed as single unit of operation.
