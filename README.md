# Go Primer
This is record of golang lang specific learnings and implementation of some algorithms in it

# Motivation
To refresh golang
Prep for Go coding interviews

# Main attributes of Go
1. Static typed 
   Compiler needs to know beforehand, which type of variable is assigned. Also do it automatically for obvious cases.
3. Multi paradigm
4. Fully compiled
5. Single binary output

# Learn from the open source community
This is a continually updated, open source project.

# Contributions 

Feel free to submit pull requests to help:

Fix errors
Improve sections
Add new sections

# Points to Remember
1. Name your variable meaningfully, that can potential reduce error by half and make code more readable/debuggable
2. Modularise your code and use supporting functions for repitative activities, it reduces overall coding time
3. Asses Complexity of data structure / algorithms before implementing them.
